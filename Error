Hema agreed with Anis that if I communicated the consolidated work completed, she would be satisfied. However, during the call, it was discussed as a weekly or fortnightly occurrence. But soon after, she scheduled two weekly scrum calls for 7:30. Initially, I was okay with it, but I'll not be able to work in US timings daily.I'll wait for Anis to respond to your email. For now, I'll continue with the user stories, but for further tasks, I'll wait for approval from either you or Anis once everything is clarified. I'll take instructions from both of you to understand my role and task assignments.
