Hi Hema,I'm currently working on the task assigned by Arun, waiting for Jenkins details and access. While I'm not entirely sure about the context of the recent call between you and Hajar, I understand the requirement for me to work during US shift hours. I've shared my feedback on this.Also, as we discussed, you were to schedule a call with Anis, Lionel, and me regarding tasks related to non-prod and prod. However, I don't see any meeting scheduled for this, nor have I received confirmation from Squad 1.Additionally, I'd like to note that initially, the agreement was different, and now it's been expected for me to work in the US shift or extend my shift.However, Hajar will be scheduling the meeting. Once everything is clarified and I have clear instructions from the DevOps team (on scope of my work & shift) , I'll take up the next task based on their input (if I continue to work on this project). Until then, I might not be attending scrum, but I'll keep you posted on the current task.Thank you."
